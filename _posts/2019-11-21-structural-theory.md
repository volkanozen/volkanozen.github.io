> "Geology involves the methodology of *hermeneutics*, which originated in the nineteeth century as a means of reconciling contradictions in the Bible. Later, the techniques were applies to other histroical and legal documents to determine the original intent of the authors. In doing ss, interpreter must assign different values to different statements regarding their clarity or intent. In the same way, a geologists gives different weights to data (such as the stratigraphic continuity of an outcrop) based on the clues of past events and processes in a way analogous to how a pphyscia makes a diagnosis or a dedective builds a circumstantial case against a defendant (Frodeman, 1995:963)" 

From Ronald E. Martin (1998)
